Compatible with Archipelago v0.2.6+ and PopTracker v0.20.1+

## Installation

Just download the lastest build and put in your packs folder (as a zip or unpacked, both works).

### PopTracker

For PopTracker the packs folder can be under `USER/Documents/PopTracker/packs`, `USER/PopTracker/packs` or `APP/packs`, where `USER` stands for your user directory and `APP` for the PopTracker installation directory.

## Customization

### PopTracker

For Customization in PopTracker just edit the pack's files. Documenation for PopTracker's pack format can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/blob/master/doc/PACKS.md).
For example: if you want to change the broadcast layout, you can add your desired layout to the `layout/broadcast.json` file.
Make sure you have you layout backed up tho, so you don't lose it when you override the file while updating the pack.

## Autotracking

This pack requires autotracking. It uses PopTracker's AP **and** SNES autotracking interface. It will track locations and items via the AP interface and use the SNES interface to track bosses and local items and mark doors and transtions while you go through the game. Requirements for Autotracking in PopTracker can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/#auto-tracking).
